# Problem
Given a graph with n nodes and m monodirectional edges. If a all vertices are reachable from any other vertex, print "YES", otherwise print "NO" along with one pair of vertices that is not reachable.

# Solution
all nodes are inter-reachable only if the entire graph is a strongly-connected component.
Graph is strongly connected if
