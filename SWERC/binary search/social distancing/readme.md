# Problem
Given an array with M sub-intervals (pastures), place N elements at distinct points on these intervals, as to maximize D: the closest distance between two elements.
- elements can be placed on the edges of sub-intervals

# Solution
- how to check if x is in an interval?   if its lower_bound is the first element of an interval
